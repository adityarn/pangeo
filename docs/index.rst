Welcome to Pangeo
=================

*Pangeo is a community-driven platform for Big Data geoscience.*

The project has three main goals:

#. Foster collaboration around the open source scientific python ecosystem for
   ocean / atmosphere / land / climate science
#. Build out the stack with domain-specific packages
#. Scale out the stack to handle petabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud
   platforms

There are different entry points to our documentation for different types of
users:

- **Science users**: read the :ref:`quickstart`, browse the :ref:`use-cases`, or
  read about the :ref:`packages`.
- **Developers / system administrators**: learn about the :ref:`architecture`
  or read the :ref:`setup-guides`.
- **General interest**: learn :ref:`about` and see the :ref:`collaborators`.
