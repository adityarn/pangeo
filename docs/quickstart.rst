Pangeo Guide for Scientists
===========================

The goal of Pangeo is to make it quicker and easier to go from raw data to
scientific insights.
We want to spend less time writing boilerplate code and be able to iterate
calculations quickly on very large datasets.
These are ambitious yet achievable long-term goals.
Reaching them will require scientists to participate in the open source process
and contribute to the development of the underlying tools.
For people coming from proprietary computing environments such as MATLAB, this
can mean changing the way you think about software and your relationship to it.

Below is a list of steps you can take to participate in the Pangeo project and
take advantage of the tools we are developing.

✅ Learn About the Open Source Ecosystem
----------------------------------------

If you are new to open source scientific software, you might want to learn a
bit about the history and context of this community.
We recommend the following talk by `Jake VanderPlas <http://vanderplas.com/>`_
entitled *PyData 101*.

GitHub_ has become absolutely central to the way this community works.
The Pangeo project is a GitHub-native organization.
A great general-audience introduction to the power and popularity of GitHub
can be found in the Wired article
`The GitHub Revolution: Why We're All in Open Source Now <https://www.wired.com/2013/03/github/>`_
by Mikeal Rogers.
